API tests need **PostgreSQL and Redis** running (`npm run db:up`, or local services). They use a
separate database, `zproo_test`, which is created, migrated and loaded with reference data
automatically before each run (`apps/api/test/globalSetup.ts`), and truncated between tests. The
setup refuses to run against a database whose URL does not contain `test`. Override with
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` / `TEST_REDIS_URL`. Test files run one at a time because they share the database.

External providers are replaced by fakes (`test/helpers.ts`): SMS and email providers record
messages so tests read the real OTP, and a fake identity verifier stands in for Google. The real
OIDC verifier is tested against a local JWKS server with genuinely signed tokens.

## Lighthouse (home page, production build, prerendered)

Measured with Lighthouse 12 against `vite preview` (compressed), three runs each:

| Profile                            | Performance | Accessibility | Best practices | SEO |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | --- |
| Desktop                            | 100         | 100           | 100            | 100 |
| Mobile (simulated slow 4G, 4× CPU) | 86–90       | 100           | 100            | 100 |

Mobile LCP ≈ 2.8 s and CLS 0. The remaining mobile cost is JavaScript execution (React and
the router) under CPU throttling.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request: install → format check → lint →
typecheck → migrate a fresh Postgres → verify the schema matches the migrations → seed → test →
build. Any failure blocks the PR.

## Coming next

- Phase 20: Playwright end-to-end journeys (signup → OTP → search → book → pay → ticket for flights,
  buses, trains, hotels, cabs, wallet) added to CI.
